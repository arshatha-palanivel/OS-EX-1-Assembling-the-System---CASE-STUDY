## PROCEDURE:
### 1.Prepare your workspace:

Choose a clean, well-lit, and static-free area to work in. Place the motherboard on a non-conductive surface like its anti-static bag.

### 2.Install the CPU (Central Processing Unit):

Open the CPU socket on the motherboard.

Align the CPU with the socket, ensuring the notches match.

Gently place the CPU into the socket without applying any force.

Close the socket lever to secure the CPU

### 3.Install the CPU Cooler:

Apply thermal paste to the CPU (if not pre-applied on the cooler).

Attach the CPU cooler according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Connect the cooler's fan to the CPU fan header on the motherboard.

### 4.Install RAM (Random Access Memory):

Open the RAM slots on the motherboard.

Align the notch on the RAM stick with the slot on the motherboard.

Press down evenly on both ends of the RAM stick until it clicks into place.

### 5.Install the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):

If your CPU has integrated graphics, this step may be unnecessary.

Align the GPU with the PCIe slot on the motherboard.
Push down gently until it clicks into place.

Secure the GPU with screws to the case (if required).

### 6.Install Storage Drives:

Mount SSDs or HDDs in drive bays or brackets inside the case.

Connect the SATA or NVMe data cables to the motherboard.

Connect the power cables to the drives and power supply.

### 9.Double-Check Connections:

Ensure all connections are secure and properly seated.

### 10.Close the Case:

Carefully close and secure the computer case using screws.

## RESULT:

The computer system has been installed successfully.
